# About Vigilance Palette Customization

## Why doesn't this feature work without an internet connection?

This feature is not supported by Sk1er LLC, which made the Vigilance library, 
thus breaking changes may be made at any time by Sk1er LLC. To make sure users 
of REDACTION do not crash if this happens, REDACTION only applies the mixin to 
modify Vigilance if the text in https://woverflow.cc/static/data/redaction_vigilance_mixin
equals to "true". If the connection fails, it will default to false and thus not apply the mixin.

## Why do I need to get support for this feature in Polyfrost, not Vigilance?

This feature is added by REDACTION, and thus all support should go to https://polyfrost.cc/discord.
